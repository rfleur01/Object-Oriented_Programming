# Create a class called MyCar. When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, allow the user to define some instance variables that tell us the year, color,
# and model of the car. Create an instance variable that is set to 0 during instantiation of the object to track the current speed of the car as well.
# Create instance methods that allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut the car off.
